# Hex Utilities

Hex Utilities is a web application meant to provide an easy way to edit and modify HEX and RGB colors in ways that would intuitively seem easy, but in practice are hard to achieve.

My intention with this project is for it to continue growing and providing an ever expanding toolset for all things color.

My priority is to develop the website as tool for my own use, and as practice for my skills.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Use either HEX (both 3 and 6 digit) or RGB
- Change the color's brightness
- Change the color's saturation
- Mix colors realistically as light would
- Mix colors realistically as paint would
- Find an adequate color scheme based on the selected color
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

Some of the main challenges yet to be overcome would be:
- Making a modern, intuitive, clean UI
- Adding the ability to change the color's brightness
- Adding the ability to change the color's saturation
- Adding the ability to mix colors realistically as light would
- Adding the ability to mix colors realistically as paint would
- Adding the ability to find an adequate color scheme based on the selected color
- Showing the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Useful resources

- [InsanIT Archived article on RGB to RYB conversion](https://web.archive.org/web/20130525061042/www.insanit.net/tag/rgb-to-ryb/) - This was extremely informative on how a RGB to RYB conversion is calculated and had a great example of just that.
- [Sessions' online color calculator](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/) - This was inspiring and gave me a couple of ideas and things to consider.
